# Deployment Build Error Fix

## Issue

The deployment was failing with the error:

```
ERROR: failed to build: invalid tag "registry.digitalocean.com//safeping-production:latest": invalid reference format
```

## Root Cause

There were redundant GitHub Actions workflows (`deploy.yml` and `deploy-simple.yml`) that were trying to push Docker images to DigitalOcean's container registry. These workflows had an empty `DIGITALOCEAN_REGISTRY` secret, causing the double slash (`//`) in the registry URL.

## Solution

Since DigitalOcean App Platform is configured to build directly from GitHub (as specified in `.do/app.yaml`), these workflows were unnecessary and have been removed.

## How DigitalOcean Deployment Works

1. **Automatic GitHub Integration**:
   - DigitalOcean App Platform is connected to your GitHub repository
   - It automatically builds from the `main` branch when you push changes
   - No manual Docker registry push is needed

2. **Build Process**:
   - DigitalOcean detects the `Dockerfile` in your repository
   - It builds the Docker image automatically
   - The app is deployed using the configuration in `.do/app.yaml`

3. **Remaining Workflows**:
   - `ci.yml` - Runs tests, linting, and type checking (kept for code quality)

## Deployment Process

To deploy changes:

1. Push your code to the `main` branch
2. DigitalOcean automatically detects the push
3. It builds and deploys your application
4. Monitor the deployment in the DigitalOcean dashboard

## No Action Required

The deployment should now work correctly. The next push to the `main` branch will trigger a successful deployment without the registry error.

## Monitoring Deployments

Check deployment status at:

- DigitalOcean Dashboard > Apps > safeping-production
- View build logs and deployment history
- Monitor app health and metrics
